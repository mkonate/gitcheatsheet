Fixing Common Mistakes and Undoing bad commits:


To undo changes to a file that is not staged, you can do:
git checkout -- <filename>


Fix bad commit message
git commit --amend -m '<new message>'
This changes the git history. This is problematique in shared projects...

Forgot to add a file to our previous commit
git add <file>
git commit --amend


Been committing to the wrong branch:
git checkout correct-branch
git cherry-pick <hash>
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard <hash>
git clean -fd


git reflog
git revert hash
This does not rewrite history. It makes a new commit and reverts the changes of a previous commit

git stash save "a good message to remember what we did"
git stash list
git stash apply stash{0} //Doesn't remove the stash from the stash list
git stash pop //applies the top stash and removes it from the stash list
git stash drop stash{0} //removes the stash from the stash list without applying it
git stash clear // removes all the stashes. Be careful with this one :-)
